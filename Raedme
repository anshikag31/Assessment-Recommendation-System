###Intelligent SHL Assessment Recommendation System

Objective : To build a smart recommendation engine that suggests relevant SHL assessments based on recruiter queries. The system understands context, role requirements, skills, soft skills, and duration constraints using NLP and traditional ML techniques.

Approach : We adopted a hybrid scoring system combining TF-IDF-based semantic similarity with rule-based heuristics to match recruiter prompts with assessment descriptions. The goal was to mimic a domain expert's ability to parse vague queries and map them to structured assessment catalogs.

Modules and Logic

1.utils.py – Core NLP & Matching Logic
Text Cleaning & Phrase Preservation
Replaces multi-word phrases (e.g., "core java") with underscores to maintain semantic unity during tokenization.
TF-IDF Similarity
Utilized TfidfVectorizer to compute cosine similarity between the prompt and catalog assessment blobs to capture textual closeness.
Heuristic Scoring (via score_item)
Applied domain knowledge:
+4 for strong technical skill match
+2.5 for role/title alignment
+0.5 for soft skills and an extra 
+0.5 when combined with roles
+0.25 for country references
+1 for matching experience pattern
+1 to +1.5 for duration closeness (within 5–10 mins)
Small bonus for shared words
Custom Duration Parsing
Extracts duration from query and handles flexible string inputs like "40 mins" or "1 hour".
Embedded BERT model support for semantic embeddings (commented out for local resource constraints).

2.Workflow
Query Input: e.g., "Need a Java Developer with good communication skills, test duration ~40 mins".
Text Normalization: Preserve key phrases, remove noise.
TF-IDF Similarity: Find top 10 closest assessments.
Heuristic Scoring: Re-rank using the custom score function based on multiple overlapping criteria.
Output: Ranked list of recommended assessments.

3.evaluate.py – Benchmark Testing
Used predefined test cases mimicking real-world recruiter queries.
Compared system's top N output against ground truth labels for recall-based evaluation.
Included diverse job roles: Developer, Sales, Content Writer, QA Engineer, and Administrative Assistant.

4.Dependencies
scikit-learn, torch, transformers, fuzzywuzzy, re, json, requests
Local support for BERT model loading (with fallback to HuggingFace Hub)

5.Results (Sample Case)
Query: "Looking for a Java Developer with soft skills for a 40 min assessment"
Top Matches:
Core Java (Advanced Level) | SHL ✅
Automata - Fix (New) | SHL ✅
Agile Software Development | SHL ✅
Scoring matched the expected relevant assessments, verifying the accuracy and domain alignment.
📊 Final Evaluation:
Mean Recall@10: 0.2243
MAP@10: 0.0985

✅ Key Features
Handles natural language input with partial or vague descriptions
Incorporates skill-role-soft skill heuristics
Filters by duration and experience
Designed to scale with any structured assessment catalog
